Question 1
You are an analytics consultant for a recently launched company. Your company is on a hiring
spree and has been working with three different recruitment firms to fill the available positions.
The breakdown of the performance of each recruitment firm across three company locations
(i.e., Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo) is detailed in Figure 1 below.

Figure 1: Performance of the recruitment firms.
Note: entries with the pattern “xx|yy|zz” are interpreted as follows: xx = total number of
offers made/accepted; yy = number of offers for senior positions made/accepted; zz =
number of offers for inclusive positions made/accepted.

The dataset without the “Total” rows is available as a MySQL dump file (TMA_data.sql).

(a) Import the dataset (TMA_data.sql) into your MySQL server. Check the resulting
TMA_data MySQL table and evaluate the suitability of the data type for each field.
Use the ALTER TABLE command to change them (where appropriate) to save storage
space while not losing any information, and/or to change them to a data type more
suited to their purpose. If, in your assessment, no change is required to the data types,
please state this as your answer to this part and justify why.

(b) Using appropriate MySQL statements, recompute all the totals columns in the
TMA_data table, and update the table with these recomputed values.

(c) Using appropriate MySQL statements, recreate Figure 1 as a MySQL table named
fig1 by using the updated TMA_data table from Q1(b).

(d) Using appropriate MySQL statements, create a new MySQL table named easy_data
based on the updated TMA_data table from Q1(b). This new easy_data table
should contain all the information available in the TMA_data table and should be
structured in a way that makes it easy to use for further analysis and visualisation. In
250 words or less, justify the structure of your easy_data table.
